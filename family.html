For me, the best thing about memories is making them with my and only one family. <q>In the end, family is all that matters.</q></p>

	<p style="font-size: 27px; color: ivory; text-align: justify;"><cite>Family, a group of persons united by the ties of marriage, blood, or adoption, constituting a single household and interacting with each other in their respective social positions, usually those of spouses, parents, children, and siblings. The family group should be distinguished from a household, which may include boarders and roomers sharing a common residence. It should also be differentiated from a kindred (which also concerns blood lines), because a kindred may be divided into several households. Frequently the family is not differentiated from the marriage pair, but the essence of the family group is the parent-child relationship, which may be absent from many marriage pairs.</cite> by Barnard John.

Honestly, my mom is a little bit hot-headed butt she is very caring and willing to spend her money for me. My parents are the ones that loved me no matter what, looked after me when I were little, and raised me.
